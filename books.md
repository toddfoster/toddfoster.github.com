## January 2015
* Tony Hillerman, _Coyote Waits_ (HarperPaperbacks: 1992)
* Robert A. Johnson, _Owning Your Own Shadow: Understanding the Dark Side of the Psyche_ (HarperOne: 1991)

> "The Catholic Mass is a masterpiece of balancing our cultural life. If one has the courage to see, the mass is full of the darkest things: there is incest, betrayal, rejection, torture, death -- and worse. All this leads to revelation but not until the dark side has been portrayed as vividly as possible. If one went to Mass in high consciousness one would tremble at the awfulness of it -- and be redeemed by its balancing effect." (p. 23f.)

> "Unless we do conscious work on it, the shadow is almost always projected; that is, it is neatly laid on someone or something else so we do not have to take responsibility for it." (p. 31)

> "Our hero-worshiping capacity is pure shadow; in this case our finest qualities are refused and laid on another…. Today’s hero is tomorrow’s character." (p. 42)


> "The early part of adulthood is devoted almost entirely to discipline. One prepares for a profession, learns the social graces, cultivates a marriage, and improves one’s earning capacity — and all of these activities invariably create a large shadow. There are elements we had to leave behind, elements that had to be “unchosen” in order to produce a cultured life. By middle age, the cultural process is mostly complete — and very dry. It is as if we have wrung all the energy out of our character and at this point, the energy of the shadow is very great. We are suddenly subject to explosions that have the power to overturn the product we have worked so hard to create. We may fall in love, break up a marriage, storm out of a job in desperation as we try to relieve ourselves of this monotony. These are extremely dangerous moments, but they can set the stage for a whole new phase of life, if we learn how to take the energy of the shadow and use it correctly." (p. 49)

* John Gorsuch, _An Invitation to the Spiritual Journey_ (Paulist Press: 1990)

> "When we learn to open ourselves to this Spirit, we find that we serve the world less and less out of our own energy and more and more out of the vast power of God which moves through us to bless and help. God is the Doer... Service like this is the spontaneous outflow of divine inner communion." (p. 104)

## December 2013
* Robert W. Hovda, _Strong, Loving and Wise; Presiding in Liturgy_ (The Liturgical Press: 1976)

> "Part of one's service to the assembly as presider is to be willing to present oneself to the whole group, consenting to be a focal point in the action, being in constant communication with the other ministers and the entire assembly through eye contact, gesture, body posture and movement, as well as word. The self-centered person, the ecclesiastical prince, the person who is out for privileges and status is opaque in this role. If, however, the presider is close to and part of the lives of all in the faith community, one of the people, clearly the servant of all, then there is the possibility of being transparent to the presence and action of the Lord. But it is a transparency that is accomplished, not with an anonymous persona, but with oneself... So, when one functions as a presider or other minister, it is ithe whole person, the real person, the true person, the full and complete person who functions. It is you the church has chosen for this task. It is you God calls through the church. God wants no sacred alias, no pulpit tone, nor does the church." (p. 56)

> "To do this effectively bishops and priests must get in touch with their own personal need for relatedness. They must risk feeling it and expressing it. That's all. The moment they do, they will be loved; they will move us. Abyss calls to abyss. Actually we don't have to be led anywhere but to each other. Then the kingdom appears." (a quotation on p. 85)

* Father Jacques Philippe, _Searching for and Maintaining Peace; A Small Treatise on Peace of Heart_ (Society of St. Paul: 2002)

> "Let us then be convinced of this and it will be for us a source of immense strength: God may allow me to occasionally lack money, health, abilities and virtues, but He will never leave me in want of Himself, of His assistance and His mercy or of anything that would allow me to grow unceasingly ever closer to Him, to love Him more intensely, to better love my neighbor and to achieve holiness." (p. 45)

> "He converts our miseries into grace and makes salutary medicine for our souls from the venom of our iniquities." (p. 90)

> "If it pleases Him to move our boat more gently than we should desire, let us be submissive to His divine will." (p. 105)

> "But when it comes to putting broken lives back together--when it comes, in religious terms, to the saving of souls--the human best tends to be at odds with the holy best. To do for yourself the best that you have it in you to do--to grit your teeth and clench your fists in order to survive the world at its harshest and worst--is, by that very act, to be unable to let something be done for you and in you that is more wonderful still... You can survive on your own... but you cannot become human on your own." (p. 46)

> "God's coming is always unforeseen, I think, and the reason, if I had to guess, is that if he gave us anything much in the way of advance warning, more often than not we would have made ourselves scarce long before he got there." (p. 104)

> Last sentence: "Above all, never question the truth beyond all understanding and surpassing all other wonders that in the long run nothing, not even the world, not even ourselves, can separate us forever from that last and deepest love that glimmers in our dusk like a pearl, like a face." (p. 112)
