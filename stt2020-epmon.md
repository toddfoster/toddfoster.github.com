## Preparing for the Liturgy
_Preparations for Evening Prayer need not be complex. Light a candle if possible. Invite anyone else who might be in your home to pray with you. There are three traditional roles in Evening Prayer: the officiant, the lector, and the people of God (everyone else). These roles can be combined or traded._

-------------

#### The Officiant begins the service with the following sentence of Scripture:
> Let my prayer be set forth in your sight as incense, the lifting up of my hands as the evening sacrifice.  _(Psalm 141:2)_

### Confession of Sin
Officiant:
> Let us confess our sins against God and our neighbor.

**All:**
> **Most merciful God,\\
we confess that we have sinned against you\\
in thought, word, and deed,\\
by what we have done,\\
and by what we have left undone.\\
We have not loved you with our whole heart;\\
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.\\
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.\\
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,\\
have mercy on us and forgive us;\\
that we may delight in your will,\\
and walk in your ways,\\
to the glory of your\\
Name. Amen.**

Officiant:
> Almighty God have mercy on us,\\
> forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ,\\
> strengthen us in all goodness,\\
> and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. **Amen.**

### The Invitatory and Psalter
Officiant:

**O Gracious Light** ---   _Phos hilaron_

**All:**
> **O gracious light,\\
> pure brightness of the everliving Father in heaven,\\
> O Jesus Christ, holy and blessed!\\
>\\
> Now as we come to the setting of the sun,\\
> and our eyes behold the vesper light,\\
> we sing your praised, O God:  Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.\\
>\\

> O Son of God, O Giver of Life,\\
> and to be glorified through all the worlds.**

Reader:
> The Word of the Lord.

**People:**
> **Thanks be to God.**

#### The People stand as able.
**The Song of Mary**	--- _Magnificat_ --- _Luke 1:46-55_

> **My soul proclaims the greatness of the Lord,\\
> 	my spirit rejoices in God my Savior; *\\
> From this day all generations will call me blessed: *\\
> the Almighty has done great things for me,\\
> 	and holy is his Name.\\
> He has mercy on those who fear him *\\
> in every generation.\\
> He has shown the strength of his arm, *\\
> he has scattered the proud in their conceit.\\
> He has cast down the mighty from their thrones, *\\
> and has lifted up the lowly.\\
> He has filled the hungry with good things, *\\
> and the rich he has sent away empty.\\
> He has come to the help of his servant Israel, *\\
> for he has remembered his promise of mercy,\\
> The promise he made to our fathers, *\\
> to Abraham and his children for ever.\\
> Glory to the Father and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit: *\\
> as it was in the beginning, is now, and will be for ever. Amen.**

#### The People are seated.

Reader:
> A Reading from the book of Hebrews.
>
>> When Christ came as a high priest of the good things that have come, then through the greater and perfect tent (not made with hands, that is, not of this creation), he entered once for all into the Holy Place, not with the blood of goats and calves, but with his own blood, thus obtaining eternal redemption. For if the blood of goats and bulls, with the sprinkling of the ashes of a heifer, sanctifies those who have been defiled so that their flesh is purified, how much more will the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered himself without blemish to God, purify our conscience from dead works to worship the living God!
>>
>> For this reason he is the mediator of a new covenant, so that those who are called may receive the promised eternal inheritance, because a death has occurred that redeems them from the transgressions under the first covenant. _(Hebrews 9:11--15 NRSV)_

Reader:
> The Word of the Lord.

**People:**
> **Thanks be to God.**

#### The People stand as able.

**The Song of Simeon** --- _Nunc Dimittis_  --- _Luke 2:29-32_
> **Lord, you now have set your servant free *\\
to go in peace as you have promised;\\
For these eyes of mine have seen the Savior, *\\
whom you have prepared for all the world to see:\\
A Light to enlighten the nations, *\\
and the glory of your people Israel.\\
Glory to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit: *\\
as it was in the beginning, is now, and will be for ever. Amen.**


#### The People are seated.
Reader:
> A Reading from Johnâ€™s Gospel.
>
>> Six days before the Passover Jesus came to Bethany, the home of Lazarus, whom he had raised from the dead. There they gave a dinner for him. Martha served, and Lazarus was one of those at the table with him. Mary took a pound of costly perfume made of pure nard, anointed Jesus' feet, and wiped them with her hair. The house was filled with the fragrance of the perfume. But Judas Iscariot, one of his disciples (the one who was about to betray him), said, "Why was this perfume not sold for three hundred denarii and the money given to the poor?" (He said this not because he cared about the poor, but because he was a thief; he kept the common purse and used to steal what was put into it.) Jesus said, "Leave her alone. She bought it so that she might keep it for the day of my burial. You always have the poor with you, but you do not always have me." When the great crowd of the Jews learned that he was there, they came not only because of Jesus but also to see Lazarus, whom he had raised from the dead. So the chief priests planned to put Lazarus to death as well, since it was on account of him that many of the Jews were deserting and were believing in Jesus. _(John 12:1--11 NRSV)_

_The General Thanksgiving_

**Officiant and People:**
> **Almighty God, Father of all mercies,
we your unworthy servants give you humble thanks
for all your goodness and loving-kindness
to us and to all whom you have made.
We bless you for our creation, preservation,
and all the blessings of this life;
but above all for your immeasurable love
in the redemption of the world by our Lord Jesus Christ;
for the means of grace, and for the hope of glory.
And, we pray, give us such an awareness of your mercies,
that with truly thankful hearts we may show forth your praise,
not only with our lips, but in our lives,
by giving up our selves to your service,
and by walking before you
in holiness and righteousness all our days;
through Jesus Christ our Lord,
to whom, with you and the Holy Spirit,
be honor and glory throughout all ages.  Amen.**

Officiant:
> Let us bless the Lord.

**People:**
> **Thanks be to God.**

#### The Officiant then concludes with the following sentence of scripture:
The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit, be with us all evermore. **Amen.** _(2 Corinthians 13:14)_
