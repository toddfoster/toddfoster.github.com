## Preparing for the Liturgy
Preparations for Evening Prayer need not be complex. Because there are different readings for different nights, they have been left for you to locate separately, either by looking up the provided scripture references in your Bible/BCP, or by using the camera application on your cell phone to scan the QR codes in order to find the scriptures online. Locate the readings ahead of time so they will be ready. Light a candle if possible. Invite anyone else who might be in your home to pray with you. There are three traditional roles in Evening Prayer: the officiant, the lector, and the people of God (everyone else).

_The Officiant begins the service with the following sentence of Scripture:_\\
> Let my prayer be set forth in your sight as incense, the lifting up of my hands as the evening sacrifice.  _(Psalm 141:2)_

## Confession of Sin
Officiant:
> Let us confess our sins against God and our neighbor.

All:

> **Most merciful God,\\
we confess that we have sinned against you\\
in thought, word, and deed,\\
by what we have done,\\
and by what we have left undone.\\
We have not loved you with our whole heart;\\
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.\\
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.\\
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,\\
have mercy on us and forgive us;\\
that we may delight in your will,\\
and walk in your ways,\\
to the glory of your\\
Name. Amen.**

Officiant:
> Almighty God have mercy on us,\\
> forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ,\\
> strengthen us in all goodness,\\
> and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. **Amen.**

## The Invitatory and Psalter
Officiant:
> O God, make speed to save us.

People:
> **O Lord, make haste to help us.**

All:
> **Glory to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit:\\
> as it was in the beginning, is now, and will be for ever.  Amen.\\

All:
> O Gracious Light	Phos hilaron\\
> O gracious light,\\
> pure brightness of the everliving Father in heaven,\\
> O Jesus Christ, holy and blessed!**\\
>\\
> **Now as we come to the setting of the sun,\\
> and our eyes behold the vesper light,\\
> we sing your praised, O God:  Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.\\
>\\
> You are worthy at all times to be praised by happy voices,\\
> O Son of God, O Giver of Life,\\
> and to be glorified through all the worlds.**

your justice like the great deep; *
you save both man and beast, O Lord.

7 How priceless is your love, O God! *
your people take refuge under the shadow of your wings.

and in your light we see light.

The Apostles' Creed
Officiant and People together, all standing
I believe in God, the Father almighty,
creator of heaven and earth.
I believe in Jesus Christ, his only Son, our Lord.
He was conceived by the power of the Holy Spirit
	and born of the Virgin Mary.
He suffered under Pontius Pilate,
	was crucified, died, and was buried.
He descended to the dead.
On the third day he rose again.
He ascended into heaven,
	and is seated at the right hand of the Father.
He will come again to judge the living and the dead.
I believe in the Holy Spirit,
the holy catholic Church,
the communion of saints,
the forgiveness of sins,
the resurrection of the body,
and the life everlasting.  Amen.

Monday
Almighty God, whose most dear Son went not up to joy but first he suffered pain, and entered not into glory before he was crucified: Mercifully grant that we, walking in the way of the cross, may find it none other than the way of life and peace; through Jesus Christ your Son our Lord, who lives and reigns with you and the Holy Spirit, one God, for ever and ever. Amen.
Tuesday
O God, by the passion of your blessed Son you made an instrument of shameful death to be for us the means of life: Grant us so to glory in the cross of Christ, that we may gladly suffer shame and loss for the sake of your Son our Savior Jesus Christ; who lives and reigns with you and the Holy Spirit, one God, for ever and ever. Amen.
Wednesday
Lord God, whose blessed Son our Savior gave his body to be whipped and his face to be spit upon: Give us grace to accept joyfully the sufferings of the present time, confident of the glory that shall be revealed; through Jesus Christ your Son our Lord, who lives and reigns with you and the Holy Spirit, one God, for ever and ever. Amen.

A Collect for the Presence of Christ
Lord Jesus, stay with us, for evening is at hand and the day is past; be our companion in the way, kindle our hearts, and awaken hope, that we may know you as you are revealed in Scripture and the breaking of bread.  Grant this for the sake of your love.  Amen.

A Prayer for Mission
Keep watch, dear Lord, with those who work, or watch, or weep this night, and give your angels charge over those who sleep.  Tend the sick, Lord Christ; give rest to the weary, bless the dying, soothe the suffering, pity the afflicted, shield the joyous; and all for your love's sake.  Amen.

Here may be sung a hymn or anthem.

Intercessions and thanksgivings may follow.

The General Thanksgiving
Officiant and People
Almighty God, Father of all mercies,
we your unworthy servants give you humble thanks
for all your goodness and loving-kindness
to us and to all whom you have made.
We bless you for our creation, preservation,
and all the blessings of this life;
but above all for your immeasurable love
in the redemption of the world by our Lord Jesus Christ;
for the means of grace, and for the hope of glory.
And, we pray, give us such an awareness of your mercies,
that with truly thankful hearts we may show forth your praise,
not only with our lips, but in our lives,
by giving up our selves to your service,
and by walking before you
in holiness and righteousness all our days;
through Jesus Christ our Lord,
to whom, with you and the Holy Spirit,
be honor and glory throughout all ages.  Amen.

Officiant:	Let us bless the Lord.
People:	Thanks be to God.

May the God of hope fill us with all joy and peace in believing through the power of the Holy Spirit.  Amen. Romans 15:13
