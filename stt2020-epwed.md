### Preparing for the Liturgy
_Preparations for Evening Prayer need not be complex. Because there are different readings for different nights, they have been left for you to locate separately, either by looking up the provided scripture references in your Bible/BCP, or by using the camera application on your cell phone to scan the QR codes in order to find the scriptures online. Locate the readings ahead of time so they will be ready. Light a candle if possible. Invite anyone else who might be in your home to pray with you. There are three traditional roles in Evening Prayer: the officiant, the lector, and the people of God (everyone else)._

-------------


#### The Officiant begins the service with the following sentence of Scripture:
> I will bless the Lord who gives me counsel; my heart teaches me, night after night.  I have set the Lord always before me; because he is at my right hand, I shall not fall.  _(Psalm 16:7,8)_

### Confession of Sin
Officiant:
> Let us confess our sins against God and our neighbor.

**All:**
> **Most merciful God,\\
we confess that we have sinned against you\\
in thought, word, and deed,\\
by what we have done,\\
and by what we have left undone.\\
We have not loved you with our whole heart;\\
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.\\
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.\\
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,\\
have mercy on us and forgive us;\\
that we may delight in your will,\\
and walk in your ways,\\
to the glory of your\\
Name. Amen.**

Officiant:
> Almighty God have mercy on us,\\
> forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ,\\
> strengthen us in all goodness,\\
> and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. **Amen.**

### The Invitatory and Psalter
Officiant:
> O God, make speed to save us.

**People:**
> **O Lord, make haste to help us.**

**All:**
> **Glory to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit:\\
> as it was in the beginning, is now, and will be for ever.  Amen.**

**O Gracious Light** ---   _Phos hilaron_

**All:**
> **O gracious light,\\
> pure brightness of the everliving Father in heaven,\\
> O Jesus Christ, holy and blessed!\\
>\\
> Now as we come to the setting of the sun,\\
> and our eyes behold the vesper light,\\
> we sing your praised, O God:  Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.\\
>\\
> You are worthy at all times to be praised by happy voices,\\
> O Son of God, O Giver of Life,\\
> and to be glorified through all the worlds.**

>
> **2 Let those who seek my life be ashamed \\
> and altogether dismayed; *\\

> because they are ashamed.
>
> **4 Let all who seek you rejoice and be glad in you; *\\

>> Since we are surrounded by so great a cloud of witnesses, let us also lay aside every weight and the sin that clings so closely, and let us run with perseverance the race that is set before us, looking to Jesus the pioneer and perfecter of our faith, who for the sake of the joy that was set before him endured the cross, disregarding its shame, and has taken his seat at the right hand of the throne of God.

Glory to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit: *\\

#### The People are seated.
Reader:
> A Reading from Johnâ€™s Gospel.
>
>> At supper with his friends, Jesus was troubled in spirit, and declared, "Very truly, I tell you, one of you will betray me." The disciples looked at one another, uncertain of whom he was speaking. One of his disciples-- the one whom Jesus loved-- was reclining next to him; Simon Peter therefore motioned to him to ask Jesus of whom he was speaking. So while reclining next to Jesus, he asked him, "Lord, who is it?" Jesus answered, "It is the one to whom I give this piece of bread when I have dipped it in the dish." So when he had dipped the piece of bread, he gave it to Judas son of Simon Iscariot. After he received the piece of bread, Satan entered into him. Jesus said to him, "Do quickly what you are going to do." Now no one at the table knew why he said this to him. Some thought that, because Judas had the common purse, Jesus was telling him, "Buy what we need for the festival"; or, that he should give something to the poor. So, after receiving the piece of bread, he immediately went out. And it was night.
>>
>> When he had gone out, Jesus said, "Now the Son of Man has been glorified, and God has been glorified in him. If God has been glorified in him, God will also glorify him in himself and will glorify him at once." _(John 13:21-32)_

Reader:

_The General Thanksgiving_

**Officiant and People:**
> **Almighty God, Father of all mercies,
we your unworthy servants give you humble thanks
for all your goodness and loving-kindness
to us and to all whom you have made.
We bless you for our creation, preservation,
and all the blessings of this life;
but above all for your immeasurable love
in the redemption of the world by our Lord Jesus Christ;
for the means of grace, and for the hope of glory.
And, we pray, give us such an awareness of your mercies,
that with truly thankful hearts we may show forth your praise,
not only with our lips, but in our lives,
by giving up our selves to your service,
and by walking before you
in holiness and righteousness all our days;
through Jesus Christ our Lord,
to whom, with you and the Holy Spirit,
be honor and glory throughout all ages.  Amen.**

Officiant:
> Let us bless the Lord.

**People:**
> **Thanks be to God.**

#### The Officiant then concludes with the following sentence of scripture:
Glory to God whose power, working in us, can do infinitely more than we can ask or imagine:  Glory to him from generation to generation in the Church, and in Christ Jesus for ever and ever. **Amen.** _(Ephesians 3:20,21)_
