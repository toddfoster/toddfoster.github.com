| **What is a "boidem"?** | **"Tiliches"** |
| "In many homes, people use the 'boidem or intersol' for storage - the area over the bathroom and hallway between the bedrooms with a false ceiling, to allow for storage." _Source: [Capital Property Consultants: Quality Real Estate in Jerusalem](http://www.property.co.il/information/faq.html)_ | "Tiliche" is, in some places, a Spanish word meaning "stuff."|
