### Preparing for the Liturgy
_Preparations for Evening Prayer need not be complex. Because there are different readings for different nights, they have been left for you to locate separately, either by looking up the provided scripture references in your Bible/BCP, or by using the camera application on your cell phone to scan the QR codes in order to find the scriptures online. Locate the readings ahead of time so they will be ready. Light a candle if possible. Invite anyone else who might be in your home to pray with you. There are three traditional roles in Evening Prayer: the officiant, the lector, and the people of God (everyone else)._

-------------


#### The Officiant begins the service with the following sentence of Scripture:
> Yours is the day, O God, yours also the night; you established the moon and the sun.  You fixed all the boundaries of the earth; you made both summer and winter.  _(Psalm 74:15,16)_

### Confession of Sin
Officiant:
> Let us confess our sins against God and our neighbor.

**All:**
> **Most merciful God,\\
we confess that we have sinned against you\\
in thought, word, and deed,\\
by what we have done,\\
and by what we have left undone.\\
We have not loved you with our whole heart;\\
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.\\
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.\\
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,\\
have mercy on us and forgive us;\\
that we may delight in your will,\\
and walk in your ways,\\
to the glory of your\\
Name. Amen.**

Officiant:
> Almighty God have mercy on us,\\
> forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ,\\
> strengthen us in all goodness,\\
> and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life. **Amen.**

### The Invitatory and Psalter
Officiant:
> O God, make speed to save us.

**People:**
> **O Lord, make haste to help us.**

**All:**
> **Glory to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit:\\
> as it was in the beginning, is now, and will be for ever.  Amen.**

**O Gracious Light** ---   _Phos hilaron_

**All:**
> **O gracious light,\\
> pure brightness of the everliving Father in heaven,\\
> O Jesus Christ, holy and blessed!\\
>\\
> Now as we come to the setting of the sun,\\
> and our eyes behold the vesper light,\\
> we sing your praised, O God:  Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.\\
>\\
> You are worthy at all times to be praised by happy voices,\\
> O Son of God, O Giver of Life,\\
> and to be glorified through all the worlds.**

### The Psalm Appointed
#### The People are seated.
#### The Psalm is sung or said In a suitable manner (e.g., responsively by verse or unison).
**Psalm 71:1-14** --- _In te, Domine, speravi_ --- _BCP 683_

> 1 In you, O Lord, have I taken refuge; *\\
> let me never be ashamed.
>
> **2 In your righteousness, deliver me and set me free; *\\
> incline your ear to me and save me.**

> from the clutches of the evildoer and the oppressor.**
>
> 5 For you are my hope, O Lord God, *\\

>
> **6 I have been sustained by you ever since I was born;
> from my mother's womb you have been my strength; *\\
> my praise shall be always of you.**
>
> 7 I have become a portent to many; *\\
> but you are my refuge and my strength.
>
> **8 Let my mouth be full of your praise *\\
> and your glory all the day long.**
>
> 9 Do not cast me off in my old age; *\\
> forsake me not when my strength fails.
>
> **10 For my enemies are talking against me, *\\
> and those who lie in wait for my life take counsel together.**
>
> 11 They say, "God has forsaken him;\\
> go after him and seize him; *\\
> because there is none who will save."
>
> **12 O God, be not far from me; *\\
> come quickly to help me, O my God.**
>
> 13 Let those who set themselves against me be put to shame and be disgraced; *\\

>
> **14 But I shall always wait in patience, *\\
> and shall praise you more and more.**
>
> **Glory to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit: *\\
> as it was in the beginning, is now, and will be for ever. Amen.**\\

## The Lessons

Reader:

>> Israel, in whom I will be glorified."\\
>> \\
>> But I said, "I have labored in vain,\\
>> I have spent my strength for nothing and vanity;\\

Reader:
> The Word of the Lord.

**People:**
> **Thanks be to God.**

#### The People stand as able.
**The Song of Mary**	--- _Magnificat_ --- _Luke 1:46-55_

> **My soul proclaims the greatness of the Lord,\\
> 	my spirit rejoices in God my Savior; *\\
> From this day all generations will call me blessed: *\\
> the Almighty has done great things for me,\\
> 	and holy is his Name.\\
> He has mercy on those who fear him *\\
> in every generation.\\

> to Abraham and his children for ever.\\
> Glory to the Father and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit: *\\
> as it was in the beginning, is now, and will be for ever. Amen.**

#### The People are seated.

Reader:
> A Reading from Paul's first letter to the church in Corinth.
>
>> The message about the cross is foolishness to those who are perishing, but to us who are being saved it is the power of God. For it is written,
>>
>> "I will destroy the wisdom of the wise,\\
>> and the discernment of the discerning I will thwart."
>>
>> Where is the one who is wise? Where is the scribe? Where is the debater of this age? Has not God made foolish the wisdom of the world? For since, in the wisdom of God, the world did not know God through wisdom, God decided, through the foolishness of our proclamation, to save those who believe. For Jews demand signs and Greeks desire wisdom, but we proclaim Christ crucified, a stumbling block to Jews and foolishness to Gentiles, but to those who are the called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of God and the wisdom of God. For God's foolishness is wiser than human wisdom, and God's weakness is stronger than human strength.
>>
>> Consider your own call, brothers and sisters: not many of you were wise by human standards, not many were powerful, not many were of noble birth. But God chose what is foolish in the world to shame the wise; God chose what is weak in the world to shame the strong; God chose what is low and despised in the world, things that are not, to reduce to nothing things that are, so that no one might boast in the presence of God. He is the source of your life in Christ Jesus, who became for us wisdom from God, and righteousness and sanctification and redemption, in order that, as it is written, "Let the one who boasts, boast in the Lord." _(1 Corinthians 1:18--31)_

**People:**
> **Thanks be to God.**

#### The People stand as able.

**The Song of Simeon** --- _Nunc Dimittis_  --- _Luke 2:29-32_
> Lord, you now have set your servant free *\\
to go in peace as you have promised;\\
For these eyes of mine have seen the Savior, *\\
whom you have prepared for all the world to see:\\
A Light to enlighten the nations, *\\
and the glory of your people Israel.\\
Glory to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit: *\\
as it was in the beginning, is now, and will be for ever. Amen.\\


#### The People are seated.
Reader:
> A Reading from Johnâ€™s Gospel.
>
>> Among those who went up to worship at the festival were some Greeks. They came to Philip, who was from Bethsaida in Galilee, and said to him, "Sir, we wish to see Jesus." Philip went and told Andrew; then Andrew and Philip went and told Jesus. Jesus answered them, "The hour has come for the Son of Man to be glorified. Very truly, I tell you, unless a grain of wheat falls into the earth and dies, it remains just a single grain; but if it dies, it bears much fruit. Those who love their life lose it, and those who hate their life in this world will keep it for eternal life. Whoever serves me must follow me, and where I am, there will my servant be also. Whoever serves me, the Father will honor.
>>
>> "Now my soul is troubled. And what should I say-- `Father, save me from this hour'? No, it is for this reason that I have come to this hour. Father, glorify your name." Then a voice came from heaven, "I have glorified it, and I will glorify it again." The crowd standing there heard it and said that it was thunder. Others said, "An angel has spoken to him." Jesus answered, "This voice has come for your sake, not for mine. Now is the judgment of this world; now the ruler of this world will be driven out. And I, when I am lifted up from the earth, will draw all people to myself." He said this to indicate the kind of death he was to die. The crowd answered him, "We have heard from the law that the Messiah remains forever. How can you say that the Son of Man must be lifted up? Who is this Son of Man?" Jesus said to them, "The light is with you for a little longer. Walk while you have the light, so that the darkness may not overtake you. If you walk in the darkness, you do not know where you are going. While you have the light, believe in the light, so that you may become children of light."
>>
>> After Jesus had said this, he departed and hid from them. _(John 12:20-36)_

Reader:

we your unworthy servants give you humble thanks

to us and to all whom you have made.
We bless you for our creation, preservation,
and all the blessings of this life;
but above all for your immeasurable love
in the redemption of the world by our Lord Jesus Christ;
for the means of grace, and for the hope of glory.
And, we pray, give us such an awareness of your mercies,
that with truly thankful hearts we may show forth your praise,
not only with our lips, but in our lives,
by giving up our selves to your service,
and by walking before you
in holiness and righteousness all our days;
through Jesus Christ our Lord,
to whom, with you and the Holy Spirit,
be honor and glory throughout all ages.  Amen.**
