## The Liturgy of the Palms
#### The People stand.
Celebrant:
> Blessed is the King who comes in the name of the Lord.

**People:**
> **Peace in heaven and glory in the highest.**

Celebrant:
> Let us pray.
> Assist us mercifully with your help, O Lord God of our salvation, that we may enter with joy upon the contemplation of those mighty acts, whereby you have given us life and immortality; through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.

Celebrant:
> A Reading from Matthew’s Gospel.

>> When they had come near Jerusalem and had reached Bethphage, at the Mount of Olives, Jesus sent two disciples, saying to them, ‘Go into the village ahead of you, and immediately you will find a donkey tied, and a colt with her; untie them and bring them to me. If anyone says anything to you, just say this, “The Lord needs them.” And he will send them immediately.’ This took place to fulfil what had been spoken through the prophet, saying,\\
>>
>> ‘Tell the daughter of Zion,\\
>>	Look, your king is coming to you,\\
>>	humble, and mounted on a donkey,\\
>>	and on a colt, the foal of a donkey.’
>>
>> The disciples went and did as Jesus had directed them; they brought the donkey and the colt, and put their cloaks on them, and he sat on them. A very large crowd spread their cloaks on the road, and others cut branches from the trees and spread them on the road. The crowds that went ahead of him and that followed were shouting,
>>
>>	‘Hosanna to the Son of David!\\
>>	Blessed is the one who comes in the name of the Lord!\\
>> 	Hosanna in the highest heaven!’
>>
>> When he entered Jerusalem, the whole city was in turmoil, asking, ‘Who is this?’ The crowds were saying, ‘This is the prophet Jesus from Nazareth in Galilee.’ _(Matthew 21.1–11 NRSV)_

Celebrant:
> The Word of the Lord.

**People:**
> **Thanks be to God.**


### The Blessing of the Palms
Celebrant:
> The Lord be with you.

**People:**
> **And also with you.**

Celebrant:
> Let us give thanks to the Lord our God.

**People:**
> **It is right to give him thanks and praise.**

Celebrant:
> It is right to praise you, Almighty God, for the acts of love by which you have redeemed us through your Son Jesus Christ our Lord. On this day he entered the holy city of Jerusalem in triumph, and was proclaimed as King of kings by those who spread their garments and branches of palm along his way. Let these branches be for us signs of his victory, and grant that we who bear them in his name may ever hail him as our King, and follow him in the way that leads to eternal life; who lives and reigns in glory with you and the Holy Spirit, now and for ever. **Amen.**

Celebrant:
> Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord.

**People:**
> **Hosanna in the highest.**

### The Procession
Celebrant:
> Let us go forth in peace.

**People:**
> **In the name of Christ. Amen.**

**Hymn 154: All glory, laud, and honor**
#### [Hear this hymn played](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h3a8fTTrAdE)

#### While singing, take your palms and, if possible, process out and around your residence. If it is better to stay inside, process around your living spaces, bringing Jesus into every space. Upon reaching the point furthest from the worship space, stop and pray the following Collect:
**People:**
> **Almighty God, whose most dear Son went not up to joy but first he suffered pain, and entered not into glory before he was crucified: Mercifully grant that we, walking in the way of the cross, may find it none other than the way of life and peace; through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.**

#### On the return of the procession, we say aloud:
**Psalm 118:1-2, 19-29** --- _Confitemini Domino_
> 1 Give thanks to the Lord, for he is good; *\\
> his mercy endures for ever.\\
>
>2 Let Israel now proclaim, *\\
> "His mercy endures for ever."\\
>
> 19 Open for me the gates of righteousness; *\\
> I will enter them; I will offer thanks to the Lord.\\
>
> **Antiphon: 	Hosanna in the highest.**\\
>
> 20 "This is the gate of the Lord; *\\
> he who is righteous may enter."\\
>
> 21 I will give thanks to you, for you answered me *\\
> and have become my salvation.\\
>
> **Antiphon: 	Hosanna in the highest.**\\
>
> 22 The same stone which the builders rejected *\\
> has become the chief cornerstone.\\
>
> 23 This is the Lord's doing, *\\
> and it is marvelous in our eyes.\\
>
> **Antiphon: 	Hosanna in the highest.**\\
>
> 24 On this day the Lord has acted; *\\
> we will rejoice and be glad in it.\\
>
> 25 Hosannah, Lord, hosannah! *\\
> Lord, send us now success.\\
>
> **Antiphon: 	Hosanna in the highest.**\\
>
> 26 Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord; *\\
> we bless you from the house of the Lord.\\
>
> 27 God is the Lord; he has shined upon us; *\\
> form a procession with branches up to the horns of the altar.\\
>
> **Antiphon: 	Hosanna in the highest.**\\
>
> 28 "You are my God, and I will thank you; *\\
> you are my God, and I will exalt you."\\
>
> 29 Give thanks to the Lord, for he is good; *\\
> his mercy endures for ever.
>
> **Antiphon: 	Hosanna in the highest.**
#### The people find their seats.

We Hear God’s Word
The First Lesson	Isaiah 50:4–9
Reader:	A Reading from the book of Isaiah.
The Lord God has given me
   the tongue of a teacher,
that I may know how to sustain
   the weary with a word.
Morning by morning he wakens—
   wakens my ear
   to listen as those who are taught.
The Lord God has opened my ear,
   and I was not rebellious,
   I did not turn backwards.
I gave my back to those who struck me,
   and my cheeks to those who pulled out the beard;
I did not hide my face
   from insult and spitting.
The Lord God helps me;
   therefore I have not been disgraced;
therefore I have set my face like flint,
   and I know that I shall not be put to shame;
   he who vindicates me is near.
Who will contend with me?
   Let us stand up together.
Who are my adversaries?
   Let them confront me.
It is the Lord God who helps me;
   who will declare me guilty?
All of them will wear out like a garment;
   the moth will eat them up.
(Isa 50.4–9 NRSV)
Reader:	The Word of the Lord.
People:	Thanks be to God.

Psalm 31.9–16	In te, Domine, speravi
9 Have mercy on me, O Lord, for I am in trouble; *
my eye is consumed with sorrow,
	and also my throat and my belly.
10 For my life is wasted with grief, and my years with sighing; *
my strength fails me because of affliction,
	and my bones are consumed.
11 I have become a reproach to all my enemies
	and even to my neighbors,
	a dismay to those of my acquaintance; *
when they see me in the street they avoid me.
12 I am forgotten like a dead man, out of mind; *
I am as useless as a broken pot.
13 For I have heard the whispering of the crowd; fear is all around; *
they put their heads together against me;
	they plot to take my life.
14 But as for me, I have trusted in you, O Lord. *
I have said, "You are my God.
15 My times are in your hand; *
rescue me from the hand of my enemies,
	and from those who persecute me.
16 Make your face to shine upon your servant, *
and in your loving-kindness save me."

The Second Lesson	Philippians 2:5–11
Reader:	A reading from the letter to the Philippians.
Let the same mind be in you that was in Christ Jesus,
who, though he was in the form of God,
   did not regard equality with God
   as something to be exploited,
but emptied himself,
   taking the form of a slave,
   being born in human likeness.
And being found in human form,
   he humbled himself
   and became obedient to the point of death—
   even death on a cross.
Therefore God also highly exalted him
   and gave him the name
   that is above every name,
so that at the name of Jesus
   every knee should bend,
   in heaven and on earth and under the earth,
and every tongue should confess
   that Jesus Christ is Lord,
   to the glory of God the Father.
(Phil 2.5–11 NRSV)
Reader:	The Word of the Lord.
People:	Thanks be to God.

Sequence Hymn	On a hill far away	LEVAS	38

The Prayers of the People

Celebrant:	And now, as our Savior Christ has taught us, we are bold to say,
People:	Our Father, who art in heaven,
	hallowed be thy Name,
	thy kingdom come,
	thy will be done,
		on earth as it is in heaven.
Give us this day our daily bread.
And forgive us our trespasses,
	as we forgive those
		who trespass against us.
And lead us not into temptation,
	but deliver us from evil.
For thine is the kingdom,
	and the power, and the glory,
	for ever and ever. Amen.
Confession and Absolution
Celebrant:	Let us confess our sins against God and our neighbor.
People:	Most merciful God,
we confess that we have sinned against you
in thought, word, and deed,
by what we have done,
and by what we have left undone.
We have not loved you with our whole heart;
we have not loved our neighbors as ourselves.
We are truly sorry and we humbly repent.
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,
have mercy on us and forgive us;
that we may delight in your will,
and walk in your ways,
to the glory of your Name. Amen.

People:	Thanks be to God.

Reader:
> A Reading from John’s Gospel.
>
>> At supper with his friends, Jesus was troubled in spirit, and declared, "Very truly, I tell you, one of you will betray me." The disciples looked at one another, uncertain of whom he was speaking. One of his disciples-- the one whom Jesus loved-- was reclining next to him; Simon Peter therefore motioned to him to ask Jesus of whom he was speaking. So while reclining next to Jesus, he asked him, "Lord, who is it?" Jesus answered, "It is the one to whom I give this piece of bread when I have dipped it in the dish." So when he had dipped the piece of bread, he gave it to Judas son of Simon Iscariot. After he received the piece of bread, Satan entered into him. Jesus said to him, "Do quickly what you are going to do." Now no one at the table knew why he said this to him. Some thought that, because Judas had the common purse, Jesus was telling him, "Buy what we need for the festival"; or, that he should give something to the poor. So, after receiving the piece of bread, he immediately went out. And it was night.
>>
>> When he had gone out, Jesus said, "Now the Son of Man has been glorified, and God has been glorified in him. If God has been glorified in him, God will also glorify him in himself and will glorify him at once." _(John 13:21-32)_

we your unworthy servants give you humble thanks
for all your goodness and loving-kindness
to us and to all whom you have made.
We bless you for our creation, preservation,
and all the blessings of this life;
but above all for your immeasurable love
in the redemption of the world by our Lord Jesus Christ;
for the means of grace, and for the hope of glory.
And, we pray, give us such an awareness of your mercies,
that with truly thankful hearts we may show forth your praise,
not only with our lips, but in our lives,
by giving up our selves to your service,
and by walking before you
in holiness and righteousness all our days;
through Jesus Christ our Lord,
to whom, with you and the Holy Spirit,
be honor and glory throughout all ages.  Amen.**

Officiant:
> Let us bless the Lord.

**People:**
> **Thanks be to God.**

#### The Officiant then concludes with the following sentence of scripture:
